* Replace the "Preferences" class of gastro by the stack mechanism
  used to transfer constants from python to C++. There are such
  quantities in Associations.cc, ConstrainedPolyModel.cc and probably
  SimplePolyModel.cc (the polynomial degree). Sometimes, the label
  "propagate those into python" tags the declaration of quantities.

* Add an outlier rejection of associations to the "USNO" catalog in
   AstromFit.cc

* Change the name of the LSDerivative routines in AstromFit, because
   python cannot handle routines with the same name.

* Check all direct readings of the FITS headers in the CcdImage
  constructor.  They should "just work" when we switch instrument. The
  stack in principle has a mechanism for providing such abstractions
  (Chip number, shoot number, latitude of the observatory, airmass,
  ...)
   

* Check that GtransfoPoly::fit still works with Eigen routines
-> DONE (test implemented).
