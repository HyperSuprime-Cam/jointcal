Add an accessor to -sipA and -sipB in TanWcs.h (in afw)

Do A constructor for Frame from a Fits Header which returns the image size,
  or cookup the Frame from NAXIS1 and NAXIS2

Check that GtransfoPoly::fit still works with Eigen routines


Write a real constructor for CcdImage that takes the stack inputs.
CatalogLoader should be replaced by a real Catalog.
Since MeasuredStars have a pointer on their CcdImage, this requires to assign
those in the CcdImage constructor.
The CcdImage constructor will look like:
CcdImage(const Fitsmetadata, const TanWcs*, MeasuredStarList&, 
	 const Point &CommonTangentPoint);

Replace Preferences by the stack mechanism to transfer
constants from python to C++.
